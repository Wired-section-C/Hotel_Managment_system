# Hotel_Managment_system

This program is the Hotel reservation system. Ti alows user to register, reserve rooms and provide hotel staff with options to view status and search for patrons by name or reservation code.
The program begins by declaring variabes and arrays to store reservation details for different room categories(Oceanview, Poolside, Garden view). It then enters a do while loop to prompts the user to choose between user and hotel staff options. If the user selects the user option, they are prompted to sign up by providing their name, age, gender and reservation code. After successful reservation, the user can choose a room category and make a reservation. If the user selects the hotel staff option, they are provided with options to view room status or search for patrons by name or reservation code.
The program uses loops and conditonal statements to validate user input and ensure the uniqueness of reservation code. It also handles scenarios where a particular room category is fully booked and offer alternative room options to user. <br> <br>
